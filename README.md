# YALC - [Latest release](https://github.com/0x90d/YALC/releases/latest)
YALC is (yet another) lossless cutter for video files. It's basically a GUI for ffmpeg focused on easy use and fast but not frame accurate cutting. If you want to cut 10 minutes out of 120 minutes then this tool is for you.

Right clicking on jump forward buttons will toggle auto press where it automatically jumps through the entire video until stopped. This is extremely useful if you are looking for a scene in a movie without knowing the timestamp.
